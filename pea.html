    <h1>Understanding Mental Health</h1>
    <p>
      Psycho-education helps individuals understand their mind, emotions,
      and behaviors in a calm, simple, and non-judgmental way.
    </p>
    <p>
      This page is designed to create awareness, reduce confusion,
      and encourage self-understanding rather than diagnosis or labels.
    </p>

  <!-- WHAT IS MENTAL HEALTH -->
  <section>
    <h2>What Is Mental Health?</h2>
    <p>
      Mental health refers to how we think, feel, and behave in our daily lives.
      It affects how we handle stress, relate to others, make decisions,
      and cope with challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mental well-being does not mean feeling happy all the time.
      It means being able to experience emotions, adapt to change,
      and respond to life in a balanced way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone has mental health, just like everyone has physical health.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- MENTAL HEALTH SPECTRUM -->
  <section>
    <h2>Mental Health Exists on a Spectrum</h2>
    <p>
      Mental well-being is not fixed. It changes with life events,
      responsibilities, relationships, and stressors.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times, a person may feel calm and stable.
      At other times, they may feel overwhelmed, anxious, or emotionally tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experiencing emotional discomfort does not mean something is wrong.
      It means the mind is responding to life experiences.
    </p>

  <!-- THOUGHTS EMOTIONS BEHAVIORS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Thoughts, Emotions, and Behaviors</h2>
    <p>
      Our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are deeply connected.
      A change in one often affects the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoughts influence how we feel.
      Emotions influence how we act.
      Actions influence future thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Becoming aware of this connection helps us recognize patterns
      instead of blaming ourselves.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- STRESS VS ANXIETY -->
  <section>
    <h2>Understanding Stress and Anxiety</h2>
    <p>
      Stress is usually a response to pressure, demands, or challenges.
      It often reduces when the situation changes or ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anxiety involves worry or fear that may continue
      even when there is no immediate danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both stress and anxiety are common human experiences.
      Understanding them helps reduce fear and confusion.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- EMOTIONS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Emotions Are Signals</h2>
    <p>
      Emotions are not problems to eliminate.
      They are signals that communicate important information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadness may signal a need for rest or connection.
      Anger may signal that a boundary has been crossed.
      Fear may signal a need for safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding emotions allows us to respond thoughtfully
      rather than react impulsively.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SELF AWARENESS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Self-Awareness Before Change</h2>
    <p>
      Meaningful change begins with awareness.
      Trying to fix emotions without understanding them
      often leads to frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Self-awareness helps individuals identify patterns,
      recognize triggers, and respond more consciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Awareness creates space between experience and reaction.
    </p>

  <!-- MYTHS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Common Myths About Mental Health</h2>
    <p>
      A common myth is that strong people do not struggle.
      In reality, strength includes acknowledging challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another myth is that mental health concerns are rare.
      Emotional difficulties are common and human.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeking understanding or support is not weakness.
      It is a sign of awareness and responsibility.

  <!-- PSYCHO EDUCATION -->
  <section>
    <h2>What Is Psycho-Education?</h2>
    <p>
      Psycho-education focuses on learning and understanding
      mental and emotional experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      It helps individuals understand how the mind works,
      how emotions arise, and how stress affects the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Psycho-education does not involve diagnosis,
      labeling, or giving instant advice.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SEEKING SUPPORT -->
  <section>
    <h2>When Is Support Helpful?</h2>
    <p>
      Support can be helpful when emotions feel overwhelming,
      stress affects daily functioning,
      or confusion continues over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeking support does not require reaching a breaking point.
      Early awareness can prevent deeper distress.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Pause and Reflect</h2>
    <p>
      What emotions do you experience most often?
    </p>
    <p>
      What situations increase your stress or discomfort?

    <p>

  <!-- CLOSING -->
  <section>
    <h2>A Gentle Reminder</h2>
    <p>
      Mental well-being is a journey, not a destination.
      Understanding your mind is a powerful first step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Awareness leads to clarity.
      Clarity supports calmer decisions.
      Calm decisions support well-being.
