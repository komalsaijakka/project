      <h3>Gentle, structured psycho‑education</h3>
      <p>
        Sessions blend emotional support with clear explanations of patterns, attachment, and coping —
        so you understand not just what you feel, but why.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Language that is simple, not clinical‑heavy.</li>
        <li>Visual explainers and metaphors where helpful.</li>
        <li>Room to ask “can you say that again differently?”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Environment designed for emotional safety</h3>
      <p>
        From lighting and seating to how we pace questions, the space is designed to keep your
        body as regulated as possible while we talk.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unhurried starts and ends to each 60‑minute session.</li>
        <li>Check‑ins on comfort, triggers, and boundaries.</li>
        <li>No pressure to share everything in one go.</li>

      <h3>Transparent, ethical process</h3>
      <p>
        No surprise charges, no algorithmic double‑booking. Every step — from payment to
        confirmation — is manual, deliberate, and clearly communicated.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Session confirmed only after payment is acknowledged.</li>
        <li>Clear non‑refund, confidentiality, and privacy policies.</li>
        <li>Real humans responding to calls, WhatsApps, and DMs.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Clear previews of what a session looks and feels like.</li>
        <li>Language that honours doubt instead of pushing past it.</li>
