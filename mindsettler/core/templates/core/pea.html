      <h1>What is psycho‑education?</h1>
      <p>
        Psycho‑education helps you understand your mind, emotions, and behaviours in a calm,
        simple, and non‑judgmental way. It is about awareness and language, not labels.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page is designed to create clarity, reduce confusion, and gently normalise what
        you might be feeling — so you realise you are not alone or “broken”.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="reveal-on-scroll">
      <h2>Mental health and mental well‑being</h2>
      <p>
        Mental health is how we think, feel, and behave in everyday life. It shapes how we
        handle stress, relate to others, make decisions, and respond to challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mental well‑being does not mean being happy all the time. It means being able to feel,
        adapt, and respond to life in a way that feels more balanced and less chaotic.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="reveal-on-scroll">
      <h2>How thoughts, emotions, and behaviours connect</h2>
      <p>
        Our thoughts, emotions, and behaviours constantly influence each other. A shift in one
        often changes the others.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Thoughts influence how we feel about ourselves and the world.</li>
        <li>Emotions influence what we do or avoid.</li>
        <li>Actions create new experiences, shaping future thoughts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Understanding this loop helps us notice patterns instead of blaming ourselves.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="reveal-on-scroll">
      <h2>Stress, anxiety, and your nervous system</h2>
      <p>
        Stress is usually a response to pressure or challenge and often reduces when the
        situation changes. Anxiety can stay even when you are technically “safe”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both are common human experiences. Learning how they show up in your body —
        racing heart, tight jaw, numbness, overthinking — is a first step toward feeling
        more in charge of them.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="reveal-on-scroll">
      <h2>Emotions as signals, not enemies</h2>
      <p>
        Emotions are not problems to delete; they are signals carrying information.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sadness may signal a need for rest, comfort, or connection.</li>
        <li>Anger may signal that a boundary or value has been crossed.</li>
        <li>Fear may signal that something feels unsafe or uncertain.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When we understand what an emotion is trying to tell us, we can respond with care
        instead of reacting in ways we regret.
      </p>

    <section class="reveal-on-scroll">
      <h2>Myths about “being strong”</h2>
      <p>
        A common myth is that strong people do not struggle. In reality, strength includes
        being honest about pain, confusion, and limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another myth is that mental health concerns are rare. Emotional difficulty is part
        of being human, especially in demanding, fast‑moving lives.
      </p>

    <section class="reveal-on-scroll">
      <h2>When support can help</h2>
      <p>
        Support can be helpful when emotions feel overwhelming, stress affects sleep or
        daily functioning, or confusion about what you feel keeps returning.
      </p>
      <p>
        You do not have to wait for a breaking point. Early awareness and gentle guidance
        can prevent deeper distress.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might start by asking yourself:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What emotions do I experience most often right now?</li>
        <li>What situations increase my stress or discomfort?</li>
        <li>How do I usually respond when I feel triggered or hurt?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="reveal-on-scroll">
      <h2>Psycho‑education inside MindSettler sessions</h2>
      <p>
        In sessions, psycho‑education looks like small explanations, metaphors, and visuals
        that make your patterns easier to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are always free to say, “Can you explain that again in a simpler way?” —
        your understanding matters more than using perfect terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mental well‑being is a journey, not a destination. Understanding your mind is one
        powerful step; acting from that understanding, slowly and kindly, is the next.
