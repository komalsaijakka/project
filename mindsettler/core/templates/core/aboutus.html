    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      MindSettler is an online and offline psycho‑education and mental well‑being space
      designed to help individuals understand their emotional world without shame or panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The focus is on awareness, clarity, and self‑understanding in a safe, respectful,
      and confidential environment — not on rushing you into labels.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Human‑first conversations, not clinical jargon.</li>
      <li>Guidance grounded in psycho‑education and ethics.</li>
      <li>Carefully held boundaries to protect your privacy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What MindSettler stands for</h2>
    <p>
      This is a space for people who overthink therapy, feel “too sensitive”, or worry
      that their problems are not “big enough” to deserve support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every part of the experience — booking, payment, communication, and the room itself —
      is designed to feel gentle on your nervous system.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Slow, informed consent at every stage.</li>
      <li>Transparency about what therapy can and cannot do.</li>
      <li>Clear reminders that needing help is deeply human.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we hold your story</h2>
    <p>
      You never need to perform wellness here. You can arrive confused, numb, angry,
      or unsure — and still be welcomed with respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sessions combine listening, psycho‑education, and tiny, realistic next steps so that
      change feels possible instead of overwhelming.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Confidential, one‑to‑one sessions, online and in‑studio.</li>
      <li>Flexible pacing based on your capacity and life load.</li>
      <li>Ongoing psycho‑education resources to revisit between sessions.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>A room for your whole self</h2>
  <p>
    MindSettler was created so you do not have to carry your inner world alone or
    pretend you are okay when you are exhausted inside. If this feels like the kind
    of room you have been searching for, your first session is a simple form away.
