      <h1 class="journey-title">From feeling unsettled to feeling gently held.</h1>
      <p class="journey-intro">
        Mental well‑being is a gentle journey, not a race. At MindSettler, your path starts
        with awareness and moves towards lasting emotional safety — step by step, at a pace
        that your nervous system can actually hold.
      </p>

      <!-- Timeline -->
      <div class="timeline">

        <!-- Step 1 -->
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-card">
            <div class="timeline-icon">1</div>
            <h3>Noticing: “Something feels off.”</h3>
            <p>
              You start to notice that daily life, relationships, or work are quietly draining
              your peace. You may not have the right words yet — only a sense that you do not
              feel like yourself. This is where your journey really begins.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this stage, psycho‑education resources and our social posts help you realise
              that it is normal to seek support and that nothing about you is “too much” or
              “too late” to work with.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 2 -->
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-card">
            <div class="timeline-icon">2</div>
            <h3>Reaching out and booking your first session</h3>
            <p>
              Deciding to reach out is brave. You choose a convenient online or studio slot
              using the simple booking form — no complicated accounts or instant payments.
            </p>
            <p>
              You share a few lines about what is going on. Your slot is marked as
              <strong>Pending Confirmation</strong> while we review your request and send
              clear payment details, including UPI and cash options.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 3 -->
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-card">
            <div class="timeline-icon">3</div>
            <h3>Confirmation, preparation, and feeling ready enough</h3>
            <p>
              Once payment is received, your session is manually confirmed and you get the
              option to add it directly to your Google Calendar, with all details in one place.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before the session, you receive gentle guidance on how to prepare:
              setting up a private space, headphones if needed, and what to do if you feel
              nervous or unsure just before the call.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 4 -->
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-card">
            <div class="timeline-icon">4</div>
            <h3>Your 60‑minute introductory session</h3>
            <p>
              This first conversation is a calm, non‑judgmental space to share what brought
              you here. You set the pace; your guide checks in on comfort, boundaries, and
              anything that feels off or overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
              Together, you explore what you are carrying, name patterns, and identify one
              or two practical next steps. Many people feel lighter simply because there is
              finally a structured place to put everything they have been holding alone.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 5 -->
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-card">
            <div class="timeline-icon">5</div>
            <h3>Ongoing sessions and gentle progress</h3>
            <p>
              If continuing feels right, you move into regular 60‑minute sessions. Each one
              weaves together emotional support, psycho‑education, and small, realistic
              practices to try between sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
              You decide the pace — weekly, fortnightly, or as your capacity allows.
              The focus is not on fixing you, but on building awareness, skills, and
              inner steadiness over time.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 6 -->
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-card">
            <div class="timeline-icon">6</div>
            <h3>Integration, check‑ins, and future support</h3>
            <p>
              As you begin to feel more settled, sessions may space out into periodic
              check‑ins. You use this time to integrate insights, review boundaries, and
              strengthen habits that protect your peace.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are always welcome to return for focused sessions when life changes,
              grief surfaces, or new chapters begin. MindSettler remains a steady space
              you can come back to, not a one‑time fix.
            </p>
