    <p class="eyebrow">Your MindSettler Path</p>
    <h1 class="journey-title">From feeling unsettled to feeling gently held.</h1>
    <p class="journey-intro">
      Mental well‑being is a gentle journey, not a race. At MindSettler, your path starts
      with awareness and moves towards lasting emotional safety — step by step, at a pace
      that your nervous system can actually hold.
    </p>

    <!-- Timeline -->
    <div class="timeline">

      <!-- Step 1 -->
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <div class="timeline-card">
          <div class="timeline-icon">1</div>
          <h3>Noticing: “Something feels off.”</h3>
          <p>
            You start to notice that daily life, relationships, or work are quietly draining
            your peace. You may not have the right words yet — only a sense that you do not
            feel like yourself. This is where your journey really begins.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this stage, psycho‑education resources and our social posts help you realise
            that it is normal to seek support and that nothing about you is “too much” or
            “too late” to work with.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 2 -->
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <div class="timeline-card">
          <div class="timeline-icon">2</div>
          <h3>Reaching out and booking your first session</h3>
          <p>
            Deciding to reach out is brave. You choose a convenient online or studio slot
            using the simple booking form — no complicated accounts or instant payments.
          </p>
          <p>
            You share a few lines about what is going on. Your slot is marked as
            <strong>Pending Confirmation</strong> while we review your request and send
            clear payment details, including UPI and cash options.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 3 -->
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <div class="timeline-card">
          <div class="timeline-icon">3</div>
          <h3>Confirmation, preparation, and feeling ready enough</h3>
          <p>
            Once payment is received, your session is manually confirmed and you get the
            option to add it directly to your Google Calendar, with all details in one place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before the session, you receive gentle guidance on how to prepare:
            setting up a private space, headphones if needed, and what to do if you feel
            nervous or unsure just before the call.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 4 -->
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <div class="timeline-card">
          <div class="timeline-icon">4</div>
          <h3>Your 60‑minute introductory session</h3>
          <p>
            This first conversation is a calm, non‑judgmental space to share what brought
            you here. You set the pace; your guide checks in on comfort, boundaries, and
            anything that feels off or overwhelming.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together, you explore what you are carrying, name patterns, and identify one
            or two practical next steps. Many people feel lighter simply because there is
            finally a structured place to put everything they have been holding alone.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 5 -->
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <div class="timeline-card">
          <div class="timeline-icon">5</div>
          <h3>Ongoing sessions and gentle progress</h3>
          <p>
            If continuing feels right, you move into regular 60‑minute sessions. Each one
            weaves together emotional support, psycho‑education, and small, realistic
            practices to try between sessions.
          </p>
          <p>
            You decide the pace — weekly, fortnightly, or as your capacity allows.
            The focus is not on fixing you, but on building awareness, skills, and
            inner steadiness over time.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Step 6 -->
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <div class="timeline-card">
          <div class="timeline-icon">6</div>
          <h3>Integration, check‑ins, and future support</h3>
          <p>
            As you begin to feel more settled, sessions may space out into periodic
            check‑ins. You use this time to integrate insights, review boundaries, and
            strengthen habits that protect your peace.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are always welcome to return for focused sessions when life changes,
            grief surfaces, or new chapters begin. MindSettler remains a steady space
            you can come back to, not a one‑time fix.
          </p>

        Whether you are just noticing that something feels heavy, or you are ready to book
        your first session, your next step can be small and still meaningful.
